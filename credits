    Pepe Peligroso, the daring salsa-making, guitar-strumming, and gun-slinging mariachi, had a reputation for being the
    most interesting man in the Wild West. One day, as he was performing at a local cantina, he overheard the townsfolk
    talking about a strange phenomenon at a nearby farm. The chickens had grown to massive proportions and were
    terrorizing the locals. Pepe knew he had to act fast. He grabbed his guitar, a few bottles of his special spicy
    salsa, and rode to the farm. As he approached the giant chickens, he began to play his guitar, distracting the birds
    as he hurled the bottles of salsa, sending the chickens running in all directions. With his mission accomplished,
    Pepe rode off into the sunset, strumming his guitar and singing a victory song.
